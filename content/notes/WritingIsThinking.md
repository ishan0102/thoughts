I find it really hard to capture my thoughts meaningfully in writing. Talking usually feels natural, but something about writing feels so much harder. Maybe it’s the permanence? Talking is so ephemeral but the words I write feel much more *real* when I see them on the page. I find myself second guessing and molding sentences until they sound just right.

I think this is an advantage of writing, though. Starting this blog has forced me to think more critically about my own beliefs. While this makes it harder to publish content, I think it’s made me better at thinking in general. Most of my posts never make it out of my drafts folder because half of the time I'm not even sure where I stand on a topic. But for the posts I do publish, the opinions I form are usually much deeper than the loosely-based thoughts I started out with. 

These days, it's easy to absorb what we see online and regurgitate it in our day-to-day conversations. Thinking and forming opinions by yourself is a much harder challenge - one that I find easier to tackle with writing.
