Read the following paragraph:
> Bionic Reading is a new method facilitating the reading process by guiding the eyes through text with artificial fixation points. As a result, the reader is only focusing on the highlighted initial letters and lets the brain center complete the word. In a digital world dominated by shallow forms of reading, Bionic Reading aims to encourage a more in-depth reading and understanding of written content.

Now, read it again:

If this demo worked for you, you should've noticed that you blazed through the second paragraph compared to the first. [Bionic Reading](https://bionic-reading.com/) is a startup founded by Renato Casutt, which I discovered from [this tweet](https://twitter.com/juanbuis/status/1526900107379105793?s=20&t=oNO87_mqH0x8BHOawmL1Jw). Unfortunately, the proprietary software is patented and is available [via API](https://rapidapi.com/bionic-reading-bionic-reading-default/api/bionic-reading1/), but the free tier is limited to a maximum of 500 requests per day. 

I found a [naive implementation](https://codesandbox.io/s/agitated-taussig-zfppc7?file=/pages/index.tsx) of this idea online, and I think it would be really interesting to build into a Chrome extension or something. Personally, I'd probably get through books and articles way faster with this, so I'll look into developing something when I have some free time.
