I'll keep open questions that I have here.

- How can we learn things the way we learn languages? With languages, it seems that fluency comes from repeated exposure and immersion which leads to natural comfort rather than memorization of phrases. This feels different from the approach we often take to study, where memorization is sometimes a key component. Is there an easier way to develop literacy in deeply technical subjects like math and physics through immersion, rather than memorization?
