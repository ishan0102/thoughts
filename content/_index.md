This is a space for me to grow my thoughts. I plan on adding notes about what I'm currently learning, various software topics I've always wanted to discuss, and other random musings. You can read my notes in a variety of ways. There's an interactive graph at the bottom that lets you see how different notes relate to each other. You can also use `Control` + `K` to search the entire site.

Or, browse all of my notes here:
> ### [Read the notes!](/notes)

Here are some of my favorite ones:
- [Auto Scroll](notes/AutoScroll.md): Scrolling through TikTok without your hands.
- [Integral Images](notes/IntegralImages.md): A math principle that's surprisingly powerful when applied to computer vision.
- [Code Snippets](notes/CodeSnippets.md): A collection of code snippets I use frequently.
- [Bionic Reading](notes/BionicReading.md): Demonstrating a new way to read.
