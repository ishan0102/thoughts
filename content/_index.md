This is a space for me to hold my thoughts. I plan on adding notes about what I'm currently learning, various software topics I've always wanted to discuss, and other random musings.

You can read my notes in a variety of ways. Click [here](/notes) to view the notes as a list, play with the interactive graph below, or `Control` + `K` to search the entire site.
