This is a space for me to grow my thoughts. I plan on adding notes about what I'm currently learning, various software topics I've always wanted to discuss, and other random musings.

You can read my notes in a variety of ways. Click [here](/notes) to view the notes as a list, play with the interactive graph below, or `Control` + `K` to search the entire site.

So far, I've written about the following topics:
- [Code Snippets](notes/CodeSnippets.md): A collection of code snippets I use frequently.
- [Bionic Reading](notes/BionicReading.md): Demonstrating a new way to read.
