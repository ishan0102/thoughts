Making a case for developing your own productivity stack

literally nothing has worked for me
everything i've tried: apple notes, workflowy, todoist, notion, reminders, google docs, google sheets, google calendar
i tried notion but i think it's overkill for my purpose - i got way too caught up in designing my own templates and making it look pretty to the point where it was detrimental
these days I need a few basic features: a place to store my thoughts, my to-dos, and my deadlines. i think my current stack works nicely - this website for my thoughts, workflowy for to-dos, and g calendar/apple reminders for deadlines. anything more than that becomes mentally overwhelming and makes it too hard to manage states between all the services i use. a huge nuisance when it came to notion was syncing my notion stuff with workflowy. i tried using notion in the way i use workflowy but it just felt...*slow*. to me, there's just a lot of friction when i open up notion compared to workflowy or apple notes. don't get me wrong, the notion team is filled with brilliant engineers and the app is remarkable, but for some reason i've just had a hard time using it regularly. perhaps i'm not the target audience, and that's okay!
